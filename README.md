-Collaboration and Stakeholder Alignment: Aligning security objectives with business goals to foster trust and maintain platform reputation.

-Proactive Security Posture Building: Focusing on preemptive measures to stay ahead of emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

### Tools Used

-Open Source Feeds: Leveraged to gather intelligence on emerging threats and enhance threat detection capabilities.

-MD2VH Virtualized Honeypot System: Deployed to create dynamic and realistic decoy environments for analyzing attacker behaviors.

-HoneyD Honeypot System: Configured to simulate various network services and attract potential attackers for data collection and analysis.

-LogStash: Used for real-time log aggregation, parsing, and analysis to monitor honeypot activity and derive actionable insights.

## Steps
Steps to Implement the Honeypot System for SoCalTrend

<b>Planning</b>

-Define the scope and objectives of the honeypot system.

-Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.

-Determine technical requirements and resources, including specifications for mimicking critical social media assets.

-Research honeypot types (zero, low, medium, and high interaction) and deployment options, focusing on HoneyD.

-Ensure stakeholder engagement to align goals and address legal considerations, such as consent and entrapment issues.

<b>Analysis</b>

-Map out system requirements, including specifications for the honeypot and target areas for prioritization.

-Research and select complementary tools, like LogStash, for log collection and analysis.

-Address variations in legal frameworks with a thorough review by the legal team.

-Draft timelines, milestones, and allocate resources for project execution.

<b>Design</b>

-Outline the honeypot architecture and develop plans for operation, training, and maintenance.

-Use insights from academic resources to configure the honeypot to attract attackers effectively.

-Create prototypes and mockups to refine the design and align it with existing security measures.

-Design custom decoys to mimic social media assets and enhance the honeypot's allure to attackers.

<b>Implementation</b>

-Develop the honeypot system based on HoneyD specifications and organizational coding guidelines.

-Set up the honeypot in a controlled environment and install necessary components.

-Conduct rigorous testing to validate the effectiveness of the system.

-Deploy the honeypot system while ensuring continuous legal compliance.

<b>Testing and Integration</b>

-Perform functional and integration testing to ensure compatibility with existing security measures.

-Monitor and analyze data collected by the honeypot to identify vulnerabilities or gaps.

-Reconfigure and enhance the system based on testing feedback and emerging threats.

<b>Deployment</b>

-Transition the honeypot system to a permanent deployment environment.

-Regularly review performance reports and update security configurations as needed.

-Implement iterative improvements based on feedback and changes in business or security requirements.

<b>Maintenance</b>

-Establish ongoing maintenance routines to handle threats and ensure system reliability.

-Resolve and patch bugs as they arise, optimizing the system as necessary.

-Maintain detailed documentation and update manuals to reflect operational and legal changes.

-Monitor the honeypot continuously, adapting to new threats and ensuring sustained compliance.
